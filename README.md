# WIP: BERT - the cramming way

The [cramming paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14034) showed that it is possible to almost reproduce BERT on 24h of compute on consumer grade hardware. That sounds fun, lets try it!

# TODO

* Model
 * sinusiodal position embedding
 * weight init
* wandb tracking of experiments
* parameter count
* results :p
 * test set
 * simple visualizer
 * Fine tuning on proper dataset

nice to have
* Multi gpu support
