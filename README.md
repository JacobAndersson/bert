# WIP: BERT - the cramming way

The [cramming paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14034) showed that it is possible to almost reproduce BERT on 24h of compute on consumer grade hardware. That sounds fun, lets try it!

# TODO
 * results :p
 * simple visualizer
 * Switch to the proper dataset
 * Removed duplicates from dataset
nice to have
* Multi gpu support
